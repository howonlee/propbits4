Fast Classial Period-Finding of Polynomially-Entangled Functions
===

If you can represent it with a polynomial number of weird but trivial data structures, you can get a period of it in exponentially faster time. Writeup in the PDF. I don't have modexp period finding, which is the real business and real harbinger of the apocalypse, but I got some attacks and strategems and such. Perhaps ordinary exponentially-faster period-finding of other stuff would be of interest, too.
